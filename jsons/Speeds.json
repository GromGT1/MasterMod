        Why are all of these raw values and not uniques? This is like EXACTLY what uniques are for,
        and speeds even support uniques?
        E.g.: [
            "[-67]% Production cost of [All] buildings",
            "[-67]% Produciton cost of [All] units",
            "Gold cost of purchasing [All] units [-67]%"
            "Gold cost of purchasing [All] buildings [-67]%"
            "[-67]% Science cost of reseaching new Techs" // Needs to be added
            "[-67]% Culture cost of adopting new policies"
            etc.
        I suppose this is how it is done in civ V, but uniques are one of the major features we have
        that Civ V doesn't, so why are we not using them?
        This approach requires adding these modifies for specific things that need to be added, while
        uniques can just be added anywhere. Only need to change CivilizationInfo.getMatchingUniques()
        to get the uniques of the current game speed and everything works out of the box.
